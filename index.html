    <h2>Section One </h2>
    <P>"If you have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men". St. Francis of Assisi

        It’s February again and the airwaves are becoming alive with messages of LOVE. Saint Valentine’s day is around the corner. I will also share my love with you and will recommend for you something that needs your love as well. Your natural surroundings, your environment; nature needs your love. Loving nature should be one of the easiest things to do and something that must come to us naturally. If not for anything, to satisfy the selfish human nature! Do you ask why? It’s simple, LOVING NATURE IS LOVING YOUR OWN LIFE.
        
        I have decided to share with you a few reasons why you should resolve to show more love to nature:
        
        “The loss of biodiversity and the quality of nature harms the basic psychological interests of man: nature contains beauty and wonders, offers a variety of experiences and challenges, acts as a mental anchor, generates insight and wisdom” -- Sigmund Hågvar
        
        Plants, animals and ecosystems bring important economic and social benefits. Vegetation has cultural, aesthetic and recreational importance to all humans. Interaction between organisms and their environment are important to human survival: humans rely on ecosystems that function properly for clean air and water and healthy soil.
        
        Water is fundamental to the survival of all humans. </P>

    <h2>Section Two </h2>
    <P>Whether you call it nature travel, sustainable travel or responsible ecotourism, there’s something incredibly potent, powerful, and cleansing about getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The air smells sweeter, the sun burns brighter, the colors seem more vivid, and time almost seems to stand still. Whether we’re hiking, kayaking, watching wildlife or just enjoying a quiet picnic, there’s something about unspoiled nature that simply soothes our soul.
     With Earth Day coming up April 22, people tend to start thinking and talking about nature conservation more and more at this time of year. But our goal is to encourage people to embrace the beauty of nature and wildlife all year around. So when some of our blogging friends discussed having a monthly themed blog carnival, we immediately volunteered to host a Nature Travel round-up this month to draw more attention to the joys of ecotourism.</P>

    <h2>Section Tree </h2>
    <P>FROM the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the orange gardens of Seville, urban planners down the ages have taken inspiration from nature. And those of us living in the concrete and brick jungle have perhaps never appreciated scraps of green space more than during the covid-19 pandemic. During lockdowns, city dwellers across the world have found parks and gardens – where they exist an unexpected source of calm and joy.

        That comes as no surprise to the growing number of psychologists and ecologists studying the effects of nature on people’s mental health and well-being. The links they are uncovering are complex, and not yet fully understood. But even as the pandemic has highlighted them, it has also exposed that, in an increasingly urbanised world, our access to nature is dwindling – and often the most socio-economically deprived people face the biggest barriers. Amid talk about building back better, there is an obvious win-win-win here. Understand how to green the world’s urban spaces the right way and it can boost human well-being, help redress social inequality and be a boon for the biodiversity we all depend on.</P>
